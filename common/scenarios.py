"""The demo transaction matrix.

Static hosting means every PSBT has to exist before anyone loads the page, so
"configurable" is a bounded matrix presented as pickers rather than arbitrary
runtime construction. The matrix is deliberately shaped rather than a full cross
product (which would be ~340 cases, most of them redundant):

  * a **full cross** of all seven script types x all four output shapes at the
    default input count — this is the "what does each wallet type look like"
    axis, and it's the one people actually poke at;
  * an **input-count sweep** on the two representative types only, because input
    count is really a QR-payload-size axis and doesn't interact with script type
    in any way a demo reveals. 30 inputs is the usual stress test; 100 is the
    extreme.

Both are built for both networks.
